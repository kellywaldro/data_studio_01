# NOTES

## Why I thought of this topic: 

I was at the viewpoint at the top of L'Arc de Triomphe in Paris last month, at night, and I noticed all the bright green crosses everywhere. This made me think: how are there so many pharmacies? 

Aside from that, I do miss French pharmacies, for the following reasons: 

- Convenience / easier to find 
- Smaller, no random items, just medical and cosmetic products 
- Everything is cheaper!! 

## Research Summary 
### Why are they so different? 

1. **no chains** you can't have pharmacy chains in France! Or it's so difficult that I have yet to come across an instance where there is one. You also have to be a pharmacist to own one. That's regulated by [these](https://www.ordre.pharmacien.fr/) people.

2. Where you can sell medical products is more regulated

    e.g. the **only** place you can buy aspirin is at a pharmacy 

3. Green crosses 

4. Pharmaceutical products are reimbursed under the public healthcare insurance -> more people buying things from pharmacies

5. You get the entire box of tablets, not the amount specified on your prescription. This means there is **less waiting time** because products aren't individually prepared for patients. 

6. Business hours. Only bad thing about the French pharmacy. Only the "pharmacies de garde" are open on Sundays. 

## Data I have or am looking for 

- Spending on pharmaceutical products 
- Pharmacists per capita 
    Both datasets for this are linked in the OECD doc 

- [List of all pharmacies in Paris](https://118-418.pharmaciedegarde.org/pharmacie/75-Paris.html)

- Trying to use the Google Maps API to get NYC pharmacies 
    Since they are all private (and less regulated?) I have not been able to find an exhaustive list 

## What this piece should be 
### Ideas from mentor meeting: 

- Density map around me: how does accessing a pharmacy in my neighbourhood in NYC compare to areas in Paris?
    Could make this fun and make it look like a dark map with bright green lights 

- Which countries use different symbols for pharmacies 

- Price comparison? 

- Make this "blogpost" style and compare different things: accessibility, price, inncorporate a narrative as to why these things are different
